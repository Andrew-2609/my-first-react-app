# My (First) React App

Hello! This is my first ReactJS project (I mean, I've implemented some before, but at the time I was just basically copying and pasting the code that I was "learning" in the course).

This time, I actually paid attention to the concepts and got the overall idea and functioning of ReactJS.

If you're a ReactJS developer, this probably won't be of too much help for you. It's more of a personal reminder of concepts that I might forget once in a while. I should've created different branches or directories for each course class, but I forgot that and now the backtrack of the course classes only exist in the commits history üôÉ.

Anyway, thanks for accessing this repository! Please, leave a star if it (for some reason) helped you.

Oh, the course I mentioned is this one: [React Full Course for free ‚öõÔ∏è (2024)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgkZ7MvWUAA), from [Bro Code](https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez). Thanks a lot, man!
